## Comments

I am still having this error on the terminal when making commits even after resetting the head like you recomended.

(fatal: cannot lock ref 'HEAD': is at fe608449138a38a0b001810e52a675d859a21cf5 but expected 2c976e3cb80f63fdb317559655caa32ee346e35e)

However when I look back to see the git log all the commits are there.
